== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin from WordPress plugin directory or manually upload it to your site
2. See the Help / Support page for further instructions

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I report security bugs? =

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/contact-list)

= Can I customize which fields appear for each contact? =

Yes — add or remove fields like photo, position, social profiles, categories, and custom entries via settings or a custom template.

= Can users submit or update their info from the front end? =

Yes — front-end editing and submission is supported and can be enabled per user role.

= How does the contact email form work? =

Visitors can email contacts directly using a secure, reCAPTCHA-protected form. Contact emails stay hidden to prevent spam.

= Can I group or filter contacts by location? =

Absolutely. You can categorize contacts and filter by country, state, city, category, or any custom field. Dropdowns are auto-generated for convenience.

= Can I use the plugin for a business directory? =

Yes! Contact List is suitable for listing any kind of contact information. Basically you can use it for any kind of online directory.

= Can I use it for listing company staff? =

Yes! Contact List is the perfect WP staff list plugin for creating any kind of member directory.

= Do you offer support? =

Of course! We offer support in the forums [here on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/contact-list/) and if you have a paid subscription we offer priority email support [here](https://www.contactlistpro.com/support/).

= Does Contact List work with some other plugin? =

The plugin is widely tested with other plugins, but if there's any kind of compatibility issue with some other plugin we will do our best to solve the issue.

= Can the visitors add contacts? =

That kind of contact form is a feature in the Pro version. Using that form you can collect contact data with a publicly available form from anyone who has access to the page that the form is on.

= Can I use the plugin only as a contact manager in the WordPress admin area? =

Yes, you can use it as a contact manager. You don't necessarily have to add any publicly available list of contacts on your site, you can just use the admin tools to manage contacts.

= Is this a business directory, staff directory, yellow pages directory or what? =

You can use the Contact List plugin for any purpose that suits your needs. That could be yellow pages, business listing, member directory, staff list or pretty much anything you can think of. The basic idea is to present a user friendly list of contacts on your site. :)
