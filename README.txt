Yes ‚Äî front-end editing and submission is supported and can be enabled per user role.

= How does the contact email form work? =

Visitors can email contacts directly using a secure, reCAPTCHA-protected form. Contact emails stay hidden to prevent spam.

Absolutely. You can categorize contacts and filter by country, state, city, category, or any custom field. Dropdowns are auto-generated for convenience.

= Can I use the plugin for a business directory? =

Yes! Contact List is suitable for listing any kind of contact information. Basically you can use it for any kind of online directory.

= Can I use it for listing company staff? =

Yes! Contact List is the perfect WP staff list plugin for creating any kind of member directory.

Of course! We offer support in the forums [here on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/contact-list/) and if you have a paid subscription we offer priority email support [here](https://www.contactlistpro.com/support/).

That kind of contact form is a feature in the Pro version. Using that form you can collect contact data with a publicly available form from anyone who has access to the page that the form is on.

= Can I use the plugin only as a contact manager in the WordPress admin area? =

Yes, you can use it as a contact manager. You don't necessarily have to add any publicly available list of contacts on your site, you can just use the admin tools to manage contacts.

= Is this a business directory, staff directory, yellow pages directory or what? =

You can use the Contact List plugin for any purpose that suits your needs. That could be yellow pages, business listing, member directory, staff list or pretty much anything you can think of. The basic idea is to present a user friendly list of contacts on your site. :)
