== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use the plugin for business listing? =

Yes! Contact List is suitable for listing any kind of contact information. Basically you can use it for any kind of online directory.

= Can I use it for listing company staff? =

Yes! Contact List is the perfect WP staff list plugin for creating any kind of member directory. 

= Do you offer support? =

Of course! We offer support in the forums here on WordPress.org and if you have a paid subscription we offer priority email support.

= Does Contact List Free or Contact List Pro work with some other plugin? =

You may contact us directly [here](https://www.contactlistpro.com/support/) if there's any kind of compatibility issue with some other plugin. We will then do our best to solve that issue.

= Can the visitors add contacts? =

That kind of contact form is a feature in the Pro version. Using that form you can collect contact data with a publicly available form from anyone who has access to the page that the form is on.

= Can I use the plugin as a contact manager? =

Yes, you can use it as a contact manager. You don't necessarily have to add any publicly available list of contacts on your site, you can just use the admin tools to manage contacts.

= Is this a business directory, staff directory, yellow pages directory or what? =

You can use the Contact List plugin for any purpose that suits your needs. That could be yellow pages, business listing, member directory, staff list or pretty much anything you can think of. The basic idea is to present a user friendly list of contacts on your site. :)
